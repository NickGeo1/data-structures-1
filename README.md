# data-structures-1
This is a covid case detection model made as a command application. Linked lists are being used, each holding trajectory data for a user

# Description
14 Users are wondering around randomly inside a 10x10 square with random variable velocity. 7 users are infected and 7 not.
The application runs for 10 days straight considering that one day has 270 seconds.
Starting from 0, every 30 seconds a node is being made for the linked list of each user. 
One node of a linked list contains the time, the position and the velocity captured at that point for that user, as well as if he is infected or not.
You are able to check each user's 10step trajectory for each day and interact with terminal to make other actions as well.
(for example to repair missing trajectory points or to check for possible infected users) 
.
